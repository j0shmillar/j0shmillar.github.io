### About

I'm a CS PhD at the [Networks and Systems Lab](https://netsys.doc.ic.ac.uk), [Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/). I'm also a visiting PhD at [Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk), part of the [Energy and Environment Group](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/research/eeg). 

[GitHub](https://github.com/j0shmillar) / [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jdmillar.bsky.social)

Current [research](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/meet-terra-ai-aiming-map-terrestrial-life-planet) interests include energy-aware ML and low-power sensing, particularly for biodiversity/ecosystem sensing.

I'm speaking at Cambridge on Nov 15th, and you can watch [here](https://cl-cam-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/4361570789?pwd=Nkl2T3ZLaTZwRm05bzRTOUUxY3Q4QT09&amp;from=addon)!

<!-- *   *Hiking and Running.* I endorse the [philosophical manifesto](https://www.harukimurakami.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir) by Murakami about running. I try to expand this in different landscapes. Sometimes, I track my running activity on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/13042082). -->
