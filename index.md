<!-- *   *Hiking and Running.* I endorse the [philosophical manifesto](https://www.harukimurakami.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir) by Murakami about running. I try to expand this in different landscapes. Sometimes, I track my running activity on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/13042082). -->
